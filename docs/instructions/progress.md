# Project Progress

## December 30, 2023
1. Initial Project Setup
   - Initialized Node.js project with `package.json`
   - Set up TypeScript configuration with `tsconfig.json`
   - Created basic project structure:
     - `/src`: Main TypeScript source code
     - `/src/services`: Service layer for API integrations
     - `/src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
     - `/src/utils`: Utility functions
   - Added development dependencies:
     - typescript
     - @types/node
     - ts-node

2. Core Files Creation
   - Created TypeScript type definitions:
     - `notion.types.ts`: Interfaces for Notion integration
     - `twitter.types.ts`: Interfaces for X (Twitter) integration
   - Created service classes:
     - `NotionService`: Handles Notion API interactions
     - `TwitterService`: Handles X (Twitter) API interactions
   - Created main application file:
     - `index.ts`: Contains AWS Lambda handler and main business logic
     - Implemented error handling and status updates
     - Set up environment variable configuration

3. API Integration Implementation
   - Installed API clients:
     - `@notionhq/client`: Official Notion SDK
     - `twitter-api-v2`: Twitter API v2 client
   - Implemented Notion service:
     - Added proper type definitions for Notion API responses
     - Implemented tweet fetching with status filtering
     - Added status update functionality
     - Added database schema validation
     - Configured exact property names matching Notion database:
       - "Name": Tweet content (page title)
       - "Publication Date": Scheduling date
       - "Status": Tweet status (Draft/Ready To Publish/Published/Failed to Post)
       - "URL": Tweet URL after publishing
   - Implemented Twitter service:
     - Added tweet posting functionality
     - Added comprehensive debug functionality
     - Added placeholder for tweet scheduling (requires additional infrastructure)
   - Created environment configuration:
     - Set up `.env` file with API keys and configuration
     - Added proper environment variable validation

4. Scheduling System Implementation
   - Implemented precise tweet scheduling:
     - 5-minute window checking for optimal timing
     - Prevents missed tweets with window overlap
     - Matches AWS Lambda execution frequency
   - Added rate limit handling:
     - Checks limits before processing
     - Graceful handling of 24-hour tweet limits
     - Clear error messages with reset times
   - Created scheduling components:
     - `scheduler.service.ts`: Core scheduling logic
     - `scheduled.ts`: AWS Lambda handler
     - Modified Notion queries for precise timing
   - Implemented status management:
     - Automatic status updates in Notion
     - URL tracking for published tweets
     - Failed post handling

5. Current Status
   - Notion integration is complete and working
   - Twitter API integration configured with rate limits
   - Scheduling system implemented with 5-minute precision
   - GitHub integration configured for continuous deployment
   - Core features implemented:
     - Tweet scheduling and publishing
     - Rate limit handling
     - Error recovery
     - Status tracking
     - Automated deployments

6. Deployment Setup
   - GitHub repository configured
   - AWS Lambda integration established
   - Continuous deployment pipeline:
     - Automatic builds on push to main
     - Environment variables configured
     - EventBridge trigger set up
   - Monitoring and logging:
     - CloudWatch integration
     - Build status tracking
     - Execution logs

7. Usage Instructions
   - Add tweets to Notion database
   - Set desired publication date and time
   - Mark status as "Ready To Publish"
   - System will automatically:
     - Check for due tweets every 5 minutes
     - Respect Twitter rate limits
     - Update status and URL after publishing
     - Handle failures gracefully

8. Technical Details
   - Publication scheduling:
     - Uses 5-minute precision window
     - Checks tweets from (now - 5 minutes) to now
     - Processes in chronological order
   - Rate limiting:
     - Respects Twitter's 25 tweets/24hr limit
     - Provides clear feedback on limits
     - Automatically retries on next run
   - Error handling:
     - Failed tweets marked accordingly
     - Detailed error logging
     - No tweet loss guarantee

9. Development Workflow
   - Code changes pushed to GitHub
   - Automatic build and deployment
   - CloudWatch logs for monitoring
   - Notion database for status tracking
   - Local development environment for testing

10. Current Status
